## Running the App

In this project, the root folders correspond to the Back end of the application, while the Front end is located in the "front" folder, making the server take advantage of ReactJS production-optimized files by serving them as ExpressJS static files.

Prerequisites For running the app:

First, you need to install Node.js, to see more information <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community">Click here</a>.

Second, its necesary the instalation of yarn <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable">Click here</a> for information.

```
$ yarn add mongodb
$ mongod
```

The application is divided into two parts:

Backend: Main folder

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Frontend: 

```
$ cd front
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

You also need to run a mongodb database. If you want a cloud database you have to add the environment variable ```MONGODB_URI=mongodb://link-to-database.../``` in the ```.env ``` file or in the heroku's settings.
